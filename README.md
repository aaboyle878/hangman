# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

To install the application simply clone the repo

The current file structure has milestone_3 importing the select word function from milestone_2 and will be restructured at a later point in time to simplify as we continue the project steps
